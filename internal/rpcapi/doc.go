// Package rpcapi provides an rpcplugin-compatible RPC interface to Terraform
// Core functionality, as a more practical programmatic interface than
// the CLI layer.
//
// The RPC API is for Terraform Core in particular and doesn't include any
// other ancillary functionality that the normal CLI layer might provide.
